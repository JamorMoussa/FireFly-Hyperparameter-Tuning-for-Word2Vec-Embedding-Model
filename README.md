# FireFly Hyperparameter Tuning for Word2Vec Embedding Model

**Swarm intelligence** algorithms, inspired by the collective behavior of social creatures like birds, bees, and fireflies, have shown great promise in solving complex optimization problems. The **Firefly Algorithm**, in particular, mimics the flashing behavior of fireflies to find optimal solutions through
iterative search and adjustment.

**Motivation** 

**Hyperparameter tuning** is a critical step in the development of deep learning models. How can we use the meta-heuristic optimization methods to find the best and optimal hyperparameters. This project aims to use the **FireFly Algorithm** to hyperparameter tuning for a word2vec embedding model.
